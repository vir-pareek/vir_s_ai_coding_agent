To ensure rebel communications are between humans, captcha difficulties have increased drastically. For each rebel to prove they are human and contact the base, they must solve the following puzzle:
Given a bitstring 
S
S consisting of 
2
N
2N characters (each 0 or 1), sort it using the following operation at most 
10
N
10N times:
Partition the indices 
[
1
,
2
,
3
,
.
.
.
,
2
N
]
[1,2,3,...,2N] into two sorted arrays 
A
A and 
B
B of equal length 
N
N. Each index in 
1..2
N
1..2N must be assigned to either 
A
A or 
B
B.
For every 
i

1..
N
i=1..N, swap 
S
A

  and 
S
B

S 
B

​
 .
If sorting the bitstring in nondecreasing order is possible in at most 
10
N
10N operations, find any way of doing it. If it isn't possible, output 
−
1
−1.

Input Format
Input begins with an integer 
T
T, the number of test cases. The first line of each case contains a single integer 
N
N. The second line of each test case contains the bitstring 
S

Output Format
For the 
i
ith test case:
If sorting the bitstring in at most 
10
N
10N operations is possible:
Print "Case #i: " followed by a single integer 
M
M no greater than 
10
N
10N, the number of operations to sort the bitstring.
Then print 
M
M pairs of lines (
2
M
2M lines total). Each pair of line denotes an operation.
The first line of each operation should contain 
N
N space-separated integers specifying the array 
A
A.
The second line of each operation should contain 
N
N space-separated integers specifying the array 
B
B.
If sorting the bitstring in at most 
10
N
10N operations is impossible:
Print "Case #i: -1".
Sample Explanation
In the first sample case, 
N
=
3
N=3 and the bitstring 
S
=
S= 101000 can be sorted by the following sequence of operations:
Operation 1: swap indices 
A
=
[
1
,
3
,
5
]
A=[1,3,5] with 
B
=
[
2
,
4
,
6
]
B=[2,4,6]. Indices in 
A
A are labeled with square brackets.
[1]0[1]0[0]0 becomes 010100.
Operation 2: swap indices 
A
=
[
1
,
2
,
3
]
A=[1,2,3] with 
B
=
[
4
,
5
,
6
]
B=[4,5,6].
[0][1][0]100 becomes 100010.
Operation 3: swap indices 
A
=
[
1
,
3
,
4
]
A=[1,3,4] with 
B
=
[
2
,
5
,
6
]
B=[2,5,6].
[1]0[0][0]10 becomes 011000.
Operation 4: swap indices 
A
=
[
1
,
2
,
3
]
A=[1,2,3] with 
B
=
[
4
,
5
,
6
]
B=[4,5,6].
[0][1][1]000 becomes 000011.
